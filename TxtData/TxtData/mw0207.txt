Readers of the monthly Market Watch report will note some changes in this
month's issue. These are due to the fact that, with the improved
functionality of the new Toronto-MLS system, it has become possible to
revamp and improve TREB's statistical publications. Upgrades to the Market
Watch include:

1) Active & New Listings

The new Market Watch will give an active and new listings count of
single-family-dwellings (S.F.D.) for each individual MLS district at the end
of the month. The old "listed" category, which counted any S.F.D. listing
that was on the market at any time during the month, will no longer appear.

2) Average Days on Market and Average List-to-Sales-Price Ratio

These figures will now be given on a district-by-district basis, as well as
by Area (East, West, Central, and North) and for TREB's whole service area.
They will also be given on a year-to-date basis as well as for the
individual months of the year.

Finally, figures for "reruns" and "all properties" (Single-Family-Dwellings
plus Properties of Other Types, which included some IC&I transactions) will
no longer appear.
