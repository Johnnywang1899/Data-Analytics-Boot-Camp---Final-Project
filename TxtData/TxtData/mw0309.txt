                   YOUR GUIDE TO THE NEW MARKET WATCH
Readers of the Toronto Real Estate Board’s Market Watch will see numerous upgrades to this month’s issue.
We believe that these enhancements will make the publication even more useful to our Members, the media,
and the general public. Here is a brief summary of the changes inside.


Graphical Enhancements

In response to Member wishes, a number of graphical changes have been made to the report:

1)      On the Front page, a bar graph giving a Toronto-wide figure for Days on Market has been added.
        In addition, placed throughout the body of the report is a line graph showing this same statistic for
        the East, West, Central, and North areas.

2)      Placed throughout the report, a line graph giving the sales to active listing ratio for the East, West,
        Central, and North areas appears. This figure is the result of dividing the monthly sales for an
        area into the number of listings active in that area at the end of the month. The closer the figure
        gets to one-hundred percent, the "hotter" the market.

3)      Toronto-wide active listings and sales are now given by line graphs on the last page of the report.
        They are joined there by a line graph showing the annual Toronto-wide average price for the past
        ten years, as well as the current year-to-date average price. New listings results are no longer pre
        sented in graph from, although the current and one-year-ago figures are given in chart form on page
        one’s "Housing Market Indicators" section.

4)      The TREB Service Area map has been moved to page two.


Statistical Additions

Beginning with this month’s edition, the market Watch presents several new statistics:

1)      On the front page of the report, the Market Watch will now give the percentage of list-to-sale price by
        house type in the "Single Family Residential Breakdown" section, beneath the pie chart. The new
        statistic is given in a column headed "%".

2)      In the area breakdown of house sales by type, several new statistics have been added. For each
        house type (detached, semi-detached, and so forth) in each MLS district, an "active listing at month-
        end" figure will now be given (called "ACT"), in addition to a "percentage of sales to active listings"
        (called "% S-A") figure, and an "average percentage of list to sale price" figure (called "Av. % List").

3)      In addition, for the sake of readability, the order in which some of the statistics are presented inside
        the report has been changed. The new order is as follows: for each area (East, West, Central, and
        North), monthly statistics are given, then year-to-date figures, and then a breakdown by house-type.
        Toronto-wide Grand Totals are now given on the last page of the report.
