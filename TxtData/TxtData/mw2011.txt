                                              Generally speaking, year-over-year growth in sales was stronger for single-family homes in the GTA regions surrounding the
                                              City of Toronto, but annual single-family growth rates remained robust in the ‘416’ area code as well.

                                              Market conditions tightened in many single-family market segments in November, resulting in double-digit year-over-year
                                              increases in average selling prices for detached houses, semi-detached houses and townhouses.

                                              In contrast to the single-family market segments, buyers continued to benefit from much more choice in the condominium           TRREB MLS® Average Price1,7
  November         2020              0.25%    apartment market compared to last year, particularly in the City of Toronto. The number of new condominium apartment listings
                                              in November was almost double that reported in November of last year. More options in the condo apartment market translated

                                              “The condominium apartment market is certainly more balanced than in previous years, with some buyers benefitting from lower
                                              selling prices compared to last year. However, this may be somewhat of a short-term phenomenon. Once we move into the
Mortgage Rates             November 2020      post-COVID period, we will start to see a resumption of population growth, both from immigration and a return of non-permanent
                                              residents. This will lead to an increase in demand for condominium apartments in the ownership and rental markets,” said Jason
