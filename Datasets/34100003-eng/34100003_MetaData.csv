1,"The Building permits survey covers all Canadian municipalities that issue permits. The number of Canadian municipalities currently surveyed is approximately 2,400, representing all the provinces and territories. They account for 95% of the Canadian population. Historically, the data are not strictly comparable due to the continuing improvement in coverage and the modifications to the geographical areas required to reflect the most recent census definitions."
