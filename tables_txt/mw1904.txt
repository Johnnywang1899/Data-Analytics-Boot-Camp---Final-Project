                                                 2018. On a preliminary seasonally adjusted basis, sales were up 11.3 per cent compared to March 2019.

Growth ii                                        New listings were also up year-over-year by eight per cent. However, the annual growth rate for new listings
March           2019                             was much lower than that reported for sales. This suggests that market conditions continued to tighten
                                         2.7%    which points toward an acceleration in price growth.

March           2019                     6.6%    should be noted, however, that growth in new listings is not keeping pace with sales. This points to the
